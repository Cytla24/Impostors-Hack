Carbon is Sus
Problem

One of the biggest problems plaguing humanity is the constant degradation of our world, and our lives by extension. For all the awareness campaigns geared towards climate change, one might be tempted to believe that thereâ€™s a lot of action in this regard. This assumption is sadly much different from the truth.

With all of the electricity used at airports, bus stations, train stations, docks/harbors/ports, and all the fuel consumed by the respective vehicles, the transportation industry is a major culprit when it comes to adversely propagating climate change. 

Solution

It might be a gargantuan task eliminating all avenues for carbon emission given the utility these services and entities provide. As an alternative, how about an arrangement where everyone takes ownership of their contribution to this? The idea is to have people neutralize their carbon footprints by paying it forward to support targeted initiatives. 

We present an application - a carbon footprint tracker that uses different APIs to mitigate the carbon footprint for consumers worldwide. We are passionate about climate change and hope our solution can help encourage people to be more conscious about their carbon footprints and play their part towards saving our planet. We all know Carbon is looking a little "sus" over there =).

Detailed Technical Breakdown of Solution
Use American Airlines flight engine Api data and Google's map data to determine routes of transportation that leave the least carbon footprint for each user. 
Use Microsoft Cloud Vision to convert images of food to their equivalent carbon footprint values. 
Give users the option to pay for the offset by buying the number of trees that will cover their carbon footprint for their trip or meal. This is facilitated by the MasterCard API.
The HP Challenge will contribute to ensuring customer satisfaction, satisfied customers are more inclined to cooperate!


Moving Forward/Known Issues
We would implement a camera feature for the food converter to allow users to convert their food on the go. 
Sometimes the requests timeout so we would add more tests and error handling to prevent this.

Installation/Running

Clone Repo.
